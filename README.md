# Twitter_Bot_MrSuper

OK ! Now i'm gonna explain how i use it for AutoUploadMedia, it's not masteries but i'm working in.

### My Usage

I use AutoUploadMedia.py on a Raspberry PI to automated my Twitter bot. He just post some pictures on an account and that's all for the moment.


### Usage
I download all my pics and i pull it in a directory named PICS or GIF on the desktop of my Rpi.

I launch the AutoUploadMedia.py and that's it !
